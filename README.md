Big Data is not about data but about analytics, said Harvard Professor Gary King in a recent interview. However, as of today, we have considerably more data, software, and computer power than ideas and analytic skills to explore interesting social science questions. In this meetup, we describe some creative strategies to process social media data and to extract informative results that are theoretically meaningful. Taking advantage of Râ€™s powerful set of social network and text processing packages, this meetup describes strategies to analyze message propagation, media embedding, network auto-regressive models, and survival models that allow researchers to address substantive social science questions. We will provide practical examples and code to process data and estimate sensible models of social media user behavior.
